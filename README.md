# Plant Disease Classification Using Deep Learning

This project aims to classify plant leaf diseases using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) built with PyTorch. It uses a labeled image dataset of healthy and diseased plant leaves to train a model that can assist in early disease detection and precision agriculture.

## 🌿 Features

- Classifies plant leaf images into multiple disease categories
- Deep learning with CNNs using PyTorch
- Dataset loading and transformation with `ImageFolder`
- Real-time model accuracy tracking and loss visualization
- Organized project structure and modular code in Jupyter Notebook

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- Python
- PyTorch & Torchvision
- Jupyter Notebook
- Matplotlib
- NumPy, OS

## 📊 How It Works

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Loads the image dataset using `torchvision.datasets.ImageFolder`.
   - Applies basic transformations (e.g., resizing, normalization, tensor conversion).

2. **Model Architecture**:
   - Constructs a Convolutional Neural Network using PyTorch modules.
   - Utilizes `torchsummary` for model inspection.

3. **Training & Validation**:
   - Trains the model on labeled plant images.
   - Evaluates performance using accuracy and loss plots.

4. **Testing**:
   - Performs predictions on unseen images.
   - Displays results and model evaluation metrics.

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
````

2. Install required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install torch torchvision matplotlib
   ```

3. Download the dataset:

   * From: [New Plant Diseases Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vipoooool/new-plant-diseases-dataset)
   * Unzip it and place the folders inside the `data/` directory

4. Run the notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook implementation.ipynb
   ```

## 📌 To Do

* Implement advanced CNN architectures (e.g., ResNet, DenseNet)
* Use data augmentation for better generalization
* Deploy model with a web interface (e.g., Streamlit or Flask)
